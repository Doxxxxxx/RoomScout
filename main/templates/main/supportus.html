        <p>Roomscout.ca is a project that was started to help students just like myself with managing expenses with roommates while keeping relationships strong.
            Roomscout has always been free, and I would love to keep it that way. What we ask for in return is that some people who can afford it pay what they think is
            fair for this service.</p>
        <p>We have tried to develop Roomscout.ca with a very tight budget and bootstrapping the company, however there are some things that we just can't get around.</p>
